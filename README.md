#Simple Wave File
Author: Daniel Schwartz

This is a simple class implementation for working with wave audio files. Wave files are read into memory as audio data which can then be processed and written to a new wave file.  This is by no means robust but a good exercise in working with audio data. It provides a simple way to experiment and try some wacky things.

At the moment, this assumes a little endian system.
